We got the carnitas as well which were to die for! Tortillas are just insane. Crunch on the carnitas with tenderness and juice - perfected combination. Rosa peligrosa cocktail was perfection w the egg white froth. We did a little mezcal and tequila tasting during happy hour. Such a great value! <br><br>Lucas was a phenomenal server who took our orders and helped curate our meal and timing. Great service! <br><br>Will be back!!!",

They also comped part of the bill and the manager came out to apologize. They went above and beyond what I would have expected and despite the delay would definetly dine again.",

Ambiance, great service by Lucas and the Suadero tacos are a must. Just order 2 orders for the table, seriously you won&#39;t regret it. We always start dinner with dessert, chaco taco and chocolate tres leches first (don&#39;t knock it until you try it) and we tried a little of everything. The calabaza in butternut squash mole is liffeeeee. Like how do they do it. Bringing so many flavors to calabaza?!? Cabrito y carnitas were a table favorite too! I can&#39;t wait to go back and try the cerviche. Make a reservation on a Monday night, it&#39;s the night to be out. Ask to be seated in Lucas&#39;s section and he&#39;ll make it memorable.

        "review_text": "My recent visit to Suerte was an absolute disaster from start to finish. I&#39;ve never felt more insulted and mistreated at a dining establishment in my life. The reason? The staff claimed we were intoxicated and refused to serve us, an accusation that couldn&#39;t have been further from the truth.<br><br>It&#39;s shocking that a restaurant would make such baseless assumptions about their customers. Not only were we completely sober, but the manner in which we were approached was incredibly condescending and humiliating. Instead of being welcomed, we were met with suspicion and disdain.<br><br>What&#39;s truly disappointing is that we were looking forward to trying the food and experiencing the ambiance that Suerte had to offer. However, we were denied that opportunity due to the staff&#39;s unfair and discriminatory behavior. This incident has left me not only frustrated but deeply saddened by the lack of professionalism and respect shown by the staff.<br><br>I implore anyone reading this review to think twice before giving Suerte your business. No customer should ever be subjected to the kind of treatment we received. It&#39;s disheartening to think that such behavior is tolerated in any establishment. My friends and I will certainly never set foot in this restaurant again, and I hope others take heed and avoid this disappointing experience.",

The whole interaction felt quite discriminatory as our group was racially mixed. Needless to say we will not be recommending Suerte to any of our friends and family.",
