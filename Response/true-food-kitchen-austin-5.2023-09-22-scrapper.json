Only bad things were the table was soaking wet(I guess it was a good thing bc it was extra clean) and I asked for no tomatoes and they put tomatoes but my server swore she put no tomatoes in the system, so manager if you read this it&#39;s not her fault. I also got a random purple potato so that was cool. Will be back",

        "review_text": "Just wow! <br>My granny who is vegetarian was visiting for the weekend from California and I really wanted to take her to a restaurant with healthy options. We made a reservation through Open Table and had to make some last minute changes to the time due to flight delays but it was no problem pushing the reservation a few hours on a Friday night. <br><br>Our server was exceptional and came back to check on us many times throughout the meal to ensure everything was going well with our experience. She explained how the seasonal menus worked since it was our first time eating there. She also went over the specials in detail and was very professional and kind. <br><br>I tried the Lasagna Bolognese with fennel chicken sausage, mushroom, spinach, ricotta and basil paired with a glass of white wine. It was the perfect portion size, with more meat and vegetables filling than pasta which left me feeling perfectly full. It was full of flavor and one of the best lasagnas I&#39;ve tried and was light enough I didn&#39;t feel too full. <br><br>My fianc\u00e9 had the Forbidden Poke with wild caught tuna, forbidden rice, avocado, roasted mushrooms, cucumber, jalape\u00f1o, citrus ponzu, edamame, &amp; Chef Matt&#39;s Magical Dust. He loved this and said it has been one of his favorite meals in Austin. He paired this with a Mezcal Margarita which he said was a little sweeter than he had hoped for but still enjoyed very much. <br><br>My granny had the Ancient Grains Bowl with miso sesame glazed sweet potato, turmeric, charred onion, snap pea, portobello, avocado, hemp seed, and cilantro pumpkin seed pesto. She was very happy with this and it was such a large bowl we took some home for leftovers. She had the Sparkling Prickly Pear Tisane to drink and liked it very much. <br><br>We all shared a dessert which was their vegan/gluten free Pink Lime Tart made with ube, marcona almond-date crust, and coconut whipped cream. This was phenomenal, and one of the best deserts I&#39;ve ever had. It was not too sweet and had such a unique flavor. I can&#39;t get over how good this was. <br><br>The ambiance was gorgeous, very open room with beautiful decor and although it was very busy it felt very roomy and not too loud. This was our first time eating here but will most definitely not be the last time. Truly one of the best meals we have had in all of Austin and didn&#39;t break the bank either. 10/10 would recommend.",

Our food came out really quickly too once it was ordered, and the bartender was friendly. He also hooked it up by giving my fianc\u00e9 an extra pour of champagne.<br><br>Each time we came here we got the hummus, and each time it was 5/5. Definitely recommend it. The avocado toast was okay, and my fianc\u00e9 enjoyed the blueberry pancake as her entree. I got the salmon, and while the greens were alright the salmon itself was 5/5.<br><br>Pretty solid date spot. Prices are a little high but it&#39;s also in downtown Austin so par for the course.<br><br>Overall, it&#39;s a solid spot and I&#39;m sure we will be back at some point.",

We just got there right at the lunch rush. <br><br>We finally got seated and waited several minutes for our waitperson to come take our drink orders. Out of nowhere, Paul, the house manager, came along to check on us. He apologized for any wait and comped us a free appetizer. Thanks Paul. He was attentive to our table and I could see him buzzing around the restaurant during our visit. He&#39;s very personable and is a hard worker. <br><br>The hostess was very sweet as well. When we checked in, I gave her my cell number and we seemed to be waiting an abnormal amount of time. I went to check in on things when I saw that another two top had been seated before us. She explained that the reservation system was down and she was looking for people; kind of like the old days...I joked. She didn&#39;t seem to get my humor. I guess my humor is wasted on the young folks. Well, I made myself laugh! ;)<br><br>We ordered two glasses of wine, which were pricey. In hindsight, we should have just gotten the bottle. #nexttime The cauliflower appetizer that Paul recommended was delicious. <br><br>I ordered the Panang Curry with chicken. \u00a0The description said that it was spicy. Well, the first bite was perfectly spicy and then the coconut milk took over and made the dish much too mild. I would order it again but ask for extra spice. The forbidden rice was perfectly cooked. I added chicken to the dish but it needed more chicken. There was barely any in the dish. The dish was overpowered by the sweet potatoes. I didn&#39;t care for them in that dish very much. It added a nice pop of color but that&#39;s about it. The rest of the veggies were great. I only found one piece of bok choy in my whole dish though. :(<br><br>My friend ordered the kimchi fried rice bowl. She said hers was very flavorful. It looked great. She was a member of the clean plate club. #iykyk<br><br>Overall, we had a lovely lunch. I don&#39;t always prefer the half booth/half table concept but tables were spaced far enough apart that it wasn&#39;t too bad. I would come here again and again! It had been too long since the last time I had dined here. Thanks again Paul for the great customer service. Our waitress was great too. I forgot to ask for her name. ;(",
