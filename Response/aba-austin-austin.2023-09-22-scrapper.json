I did not have reservations but I was able to get a walk in spot in the patio. While we waited for our table we ordered drinks at the bar. I got the Mediterranean mule and it was refreshing and a great drink. We then ordered a few different items from the menu. It was restaurant week when I visited so we ordered one meal from there and one dish off the regular menu. To start we had the garlic hummus and it is the most delicious hummus I&#39;ve ever had. The hummus was flavorful and the garlic just made it better. The house pita was warm and paired amazingly. We also had the Greek village salad and the veggies were super fresh and light and the feta was fantastic. For our mains we had the lamb and beef kabob which was super flavorful and the tzatziki was a great pairing. Off the regular menu we had the shrimp scampi, the crispy garlic on it was fantastic. We then had the sticky date cake which was a perfect ending to the evening. <br><br>Our server Joseph was beyond fantastic as well. He had great food recommendations and provided amazing service throughout the night.",

What i got was flabby pork belly, with a gross apple grapefruit mash - no cherries to be seen. The dish was disgusting. 27$ and the bait and switch with the cherries definitely made this a no-go for me. If they are dishonest about their dishes and send them to people as to go - they aren&#39;t ethical. Avoid at all costs.",

        "review_text": "Aba is the kind of place that every millennial dreams of discovering. Talk about Instagramable! \u00a0Nestled in the heart of the city, it&#39;s a culinary oasis that perfectly captures the spirit of modern Austin dining. The food is a masterclass in flavor and presentation, with each dish telling its own story, making it clear that the chefs are not just cooking, but crafting experiences.<br><br>The service is top-tier. In an era where dining out is as much about the experience as the food, Aba&#39;s team nails it. They&#39;re attentive, knowledgeable, and have that uncanny ability to be there exactly when you need them, and fade into the background when you don&#39;t.<br><br>But let&#39;s talk about that ambiance. The expansive outside seating area is a game-changer. It&#39;s spacious yet intimate, allowing for both group gatherings and cozy date nights. The chill vibe it exudes, especially under the Austin sky, makes it a perfect spot to unwind, chat, and soak in the city&#39;s energy.<br><br>A heads up to my fellow millennials: a reservation is highly recommended. Aba is no longer Austin&#39;s best-kept secret, and for good reason. Whether you&#39;re looking for a place to brunch with friends, have a romantic dinner, or just enjoy some quality me-time with good food and vibes, Aba has got you covered. It&#39;s not just a restaurant; it&#39;s a mood.",

The ambiance is amazing, the whole restaurant has such nice decor especially the outside area where we sat. We ordered the whipped feta, garlic hummus, falafel, crispy potatoes, lamb and beef kefta. And it was all delicious, the whipped feta was my favorite. The waiter also brought me desert for my birthday, overall a great experience and I can&#39;t wait to go back.",

Our server was super nice and suggested the crackers to go along with our spreads since the bread fills you up so much. Which by the way, the bread was so deliciously fried and went so well with the dips. Our favorite was the whipped feta - so airy and filling! We got two spreads plus the crispy potatoes and that was way too much since we had the lamb kebabs coming, so my advice is to not order too much at the beginning, or just split an entree since the spreads are the star at this restaurant. The sticky date cake was the perfect dessert at the end and I highly recommend!",

It was pretty hot and would have been better with some fans , but none the less the patio was beautiful. Being that it was busy, our server Connor was not very attentive. He did not ask our party about drinks and never came back with water refills. The food was absolutely amazing! We came with a group of friends and shared the whipped feta and hummus which I recommend. I was happy that they were serving the brunch menu on Monday for the holiday!

However, everything else was pretty horrible. We booked this reservation almost 2 months out and were seated at a great area outside. The service, though, was like 1/10. The restaurant was not as busy anymore (it was a later reservation) and our server barely checked on us after taking our orders. <br><br>We ordered a bunch of appetizers and drinks. The drinks came pretty quickly, the first appetizer came around 20 mins later which we didn&#39;t mind that&#39;s pretty standard. However, we waited an hour for the rest of our appetizers which never came.. and by the time it came (one of them was potato wedges), i kid you not, it was cold. At that point we saw the table next to us with the same server and they received all of their food even though they were seated wayyy after us. <br><br>Btw our bill was still very pricy even though we didnt get everything we ordered. It was over an hour so we requested them to just be boxed to-go bc that was just ridiculous. I think we were nice enough to just let it slide and pay up.<br><br>Btw we heated up the food when we got back and they were very dry and hard... so idk what was up with that. <br><br>I had very high expectations from Aba only to be disappointed like this lol",

For bites to eat we got the whipped feta, ahi tuna &amp; watermelon, crispy pork belly, and garlic shrimp scampi. Everything was practically a home run except for the ahi watermelon, the ahi didn&#39;t taste very fresh and the best parts to this was the watermelon and cucumber.
