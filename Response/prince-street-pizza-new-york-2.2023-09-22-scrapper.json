However, a word of caution: seating is limited, so be prepared for the possibility of not finding a spot to sit down. Keep that in mind, and you won&#39;t be disappointed. A must-visit for pizza aficionados!",

There will definitely be a line, so expect to wait at least 15 minutes, but once you order, you&#39;ll get the pizza immediately. There isn&#39;t really anywhere to eat inside or outside, so you kind of have to eat while walking around or on a street corner. Amazing for takeout/delivery too! One slice will be enough to fill you, but two is good if you want to be stuffed",

I really wish they had more places to sit down and eat it but we managed by snagging a table right outside the place. We called ahead to order our pie and it was ready for pick up as promised. They have 2 sections- one to pick up pies and the other side for individual slices. their lines move quick but you may not have a place right outside to eat it while it&#39;s hot.",

The reason for the stars was the flavors weren&#39;t really there I thought it was just okay I was expecting a lot more for the price. If you&#39;re looking for the best flavor pizza I&#39;d go elsewhere. The pizza was on average fine - i tried the \u00a0pepperoni , vodka pizza it was okay l the meat lovers out of all 3 I would say this one was best \u00a0the sausage slices added some flavor. <br><br>Prices for slices are not clear make sure to ask up front. \u00a0For 3 slices and one peroni beer it all came out \u00a0to be $30. I found it to be overpriced.",

We had to wait maybe 10-15 minutes on line but the line did go fast. We got the pepperoni and Margherrita slices. Each slide was a bit pricey but they definitely did not skimp out on the pepperoni portions so you do get your money&#39;s worth. I enjoyed the Margherrita slice a lot more as I am more of a thin crust girl but the pepperoni slice had a nice chewy texture to it. I&#39;d say if you don&#39;t have to wait too long on line, it is definitely worth giving a try.",

Several people gave up and walked off as the line really didn&#39;t move much. Once we got to the counter, they announced &#34;cash only.&#34; Good thing we had cash, but I felt for those who didn&#39;t and had been waiting for so long already. We got a slice of the spicy vodka and a whole box of pepperoni. This was way too much for 2 people haha, but we figured we could eat on it later for dinner. Our total was pricey. My recommendation for two people? 4-5 slices is PLENTY. You may not even finish it all. I wish I would&#39;ve known this. There are only a couple of tables outside to sit and a little standing room in the restaurant. <br>As for the pizza itself? It was delicious. Especially the vodka flavor. Personal opinion? This pizza is not good cold. We didn&#39;t have a microwave and let me tell you...you need one for these leftovers. Again, worth trying. Just know what you&#39;re getting yourself into.",

The flavors were divine, and the sauce was just perfect in my opinion--striking the right balance with a pleasant acidity, not overly sweet. The pizza had a crispy crust with a delightful chewiness to it. The pepperoni was classic, offering that signature greasiness but perfectly crispy and not overly salty.<br><br>I made it a point to visit twice this year before leaving, even though the lines were quite long. However, the staff proved to be incredibly efficient and speedy in serving customers. On my second visit during the week, there were no lines to contend with, and the pizza was just as fantastic and fresh. Enjoying the meal inside the establishment was a treat, and the people were friendly, making the experience all the more enjoyable.",

Their pepperoni slice, with its perfect blend of flavors, is an absolute must-try. However, I&#39;ve encountered the occasional burnt crust on a few visits, which is the sole blemish on their otherwise impeccable record. As for the long lines, it&#39;s a testament to their reputation for serving some of the city&#39;s finest slices. Prince Street Pizza is a NYC gem that&#39;s just a few tweaks away from pizza perfection. A slice of heaven awaits, but patience may be required.",
