The tortillas are thin and delicate, the meat is dynamic and tender, and the salsas are refined and wonderful. Unlike the rest of Mexican food in Texas which disgraces authentic Mexican cuisine, Cuantos does it right. This is how Mexico-City style tacos are meant to be.",

I got the 4 taco special, and ordered carnitas, suadero, and cachete topped with REAL Mexican cheese (maybe panela or queso fresco) \u00a0and avocado, OMG! If I could redo my order I&#39;d get just cachete. ::chefs kiss:: So well seasoned, tacos packed with meat, fresh ingredients, just perfect.",

The beef cheek and pork stomach tacos were indeed flavorful, but I found them to be overly savory for my taste. On the plus side, the price was reasonable, with two tacos totaling $5. Overall, it&#39;s worth a try if you love intense flavors, but it wasn&#39;t my personal favorite.",

So, don&#39;t be lazy and be sure check your order before you leave because they always leave out tacos from my order (one time, they literally gave me half of what I ordered) and as I mentioned above, these tacos are small so leaving some out will leave you hungry!",

Part of a food truck park on E 12th - lots of parking. I just learned you can order ahead on their website too!",

They&#39;re also very quick to put out the order, but we came a little after the lunch rush. <br><br>All in all, great authentic tasting tacos and very quick to put out food!",

And what was even more unfortunate... was that I didn&#39;t get the hype :( Every single taco was way too salty for me, to the point where I couldn&#39;t even finish my food.",

We visited during the week when they first open and didn&#39;t have to deal with a crowd. I&#39;ve eaten at the food park before and have seen the spot completely full on the weekend.
